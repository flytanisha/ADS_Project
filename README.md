The objective of this study is to analyze the efficacy and efficiency of convolutional neural 
networks (CNNs) in the detection of Alzheimer's disease. The study also involves a comparison 
of CPU and GPU architectures. Through an examination of Alzheimer's image datasets, we 
conduct a comprehensive analysis of training speed, accuracy, and resource utilization. In 
addition, we will be conducting a comparative analysis between NASNet, a contemporary 
neural network architecture renowned for its exceptional performance, conventional 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and the VGG model on a Graphics Processing Unit 
(GPU). The results of our study indicate that utilizing GPU acceleration has a substantial 
positive impact on the performance and scalability of the model. Specifically, our findings 
suggest that NASNet shows great promise in improving the diagnosis and treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease.
